I am a PhD student at the [Universitat de Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/inici), supervised by [Sergio Escalera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=oI6AIkMAAAAJ) and [Albert Clapés](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=n4BtpPsAAAAJ). My research lies at the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, with a focus on making video understanding models more robust and efficient, with publications at top-tier conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ICLR, WACV, etc. 

During my Ph.D. I have investigated the domain gap between descriptive captions and realistic user search queries (CVPR 2026), developed methods for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (ICCV 2025), addressed visual domain shifts (WACV 2025). Moreover, I recently completed a research stay at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) with Prof. [Dima Damen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=OxL9Wn8AAAAJ) and Prof. [Michael Wray](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=gFQcKZMAAAAJ). 

Previously, I earned my Master’s from [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en) and [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/about/), where I worked on efficient attention at [LIONS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/) with Prof. [Volkan Cevher](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hlWhzU8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I also have a background in Graph Neural Networks resulting from working for 2 years at the [Barcelona Neural Networking Center](https://bnn.upc.edu/), where I engineered the IGNNITION framework (IEEE Network '21). 

I am an invited lecturer for the Master of Computer Vision at UB and have received awards from SIGCOMM and the National Excellence Scholarship.
