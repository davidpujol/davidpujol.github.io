My name is David Pujol Perich, currently a Ph.D student at [Universitat de Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/inici) under the supervision of Prof. [Sergio Escalera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=oI6AIkMAAAAJ) and Prof. [Albert Clapés](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=n4BtpPsAAAAJ). My main research interests include computer vision, natural language processing and graph neural networks, especifically applied to video understanding applications.

I obtained my Bachelors degree in Computer Science at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en), which I combined with an academic stay at [ETHZ](https://ethz.ch/en.html), Switzerland. I also obtained my Masters Degree at UPC in Research and Innovation in Informatics with a strong focus on Advanced Computing. I also combined this program with a 1 year academic stay at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland, where I undertook both courses on Deep Learning and wrote my Master Thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Volkan Cevher](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hlWhzU8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
During this time I also combined my studies with professional experience. First of all, I worked as a Machine Learning Research intern at [Barcelona Neural Networking Center](https://bnn.upc.edu/) during almost 2 years. I then worked at [LIONS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/), EPFL as a Machine Learning Research Assistant during 1 year.
